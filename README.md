MAP COLORING


Introduction: 


The provided Python code is an implementation of a map coloring algorithm using image processing techniques. It takes an input map image and attempts to color different regions of the map such that no adjacent regions have the same color. The code utilizes computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy to process the image and matplotlib for visualization.

Features:


1.	Preprocessing: The code applies thresholding, median blur, and sharpening filters to enhance the map image before processing. .
2.	Region Detection: It identifies different regions in the map by analyzing the color areas and borders.
3.	Graph Creation: The code constructs a graph representation of the map regions, where nodes represent regions and edges indicate adjacency. .
4.	Colorization: Using a backtracking approach, the code assigns colors to each region while ensuring neighboring regions have different colors.
5.	Visualization: The colored map is displayed using OpenCV's image rendering capabilities.
   

Technologies Used:


Python: The code is written in the Python programming language.
OpenCV: Used for image processing, filtering, and rendering.
NumPy: Used for array manipulation and calculations.
Matplotlib: Used for visualizing the original and colorized map.


Installation Steps:


To run the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
Python: Install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) based on your operating system.

OpenCV: Install the OpenCV library by running the following command in the terminal or command 
• pip install opencv-python

NumPy: Install the NumPy library by running the following command:
• pip install numpy

Matplotlib: Install the Matplotlib library by running the following command:
• pip install matplotlib



Usage:

•	Save the provided code in a file with a .py extension (e.g., map_coloring.py).
•	Prepare an input map image (e.g., india2.jpg) and make sure to specify the correct image path in the code.
•	Run the code using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook.


Contributions:


The provided code is a single-file implementation, and any contributions or modifications can be made directly to the existing code. If you want to enhance or extend the functionality, you can add additional features like user interaction for selecting regions or improve the efficiency of the coloring algorithm.
